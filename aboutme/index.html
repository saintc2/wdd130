<p>My name is Charles Odili, I'm a professional Photographer and Cinematographer,
Creativity comes naturally to me, so I'm working toward a Major in Professional Studies BS.
<P></P>I'm married to an amazing woman and we have two lovely kids, my boy Liam his 3 
and my daughter Zoe she'll be 2 next year.
    
<P></P>I'm really excited to be here and can't wait to learn and grow with all of you. 
I've learned a lot already because I have no prior knowledge about wed development,
I'm looking forward to designing my personal creative wedsite and I'm working toward 
transitioning to a Multimedia designer and I know this course will set me in the right path.
    
<p></p>I've been a member of the church for 21 year, I served a full time mission I Ghana Accra mission.
    
<p></p>Thanks.</P></p>
